# AOTW_Week3

## Explanation and rules

AOTW is a recurring series I would like to try. The acronym stands for **App Of The Week**.
The premise is very simple: every week, I have a new assignment—an application of some sort.
The first few days are spent ensuring that the most basic functions of the app are acceptable.
This is the end goal. Once the main end goal has been reached, I add stretch goals.

**I must make at least one commit a day**, with the exception of Saturday and Sunday, which are optional.

## This week’s app is: 
# DELAYED
The base goal is TBD

**Stretch goals will be added here:**  

# Delay:  
This week's project is delayed by a week. Multiple compounding commitments  
this week means I will have to postpone this project until next week.  
AOTW will return next week and this GitHub will be updated to represent  
that once the postpone is over.
